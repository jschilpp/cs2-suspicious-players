# How many suspicious players are playing Counterstrike 2?

Scripts and data to quantify the number of suspicious players in Counterstrike 2 that were removed with the ban wave on January 4, 2024. Read the complete story [here on Medium (free of charge).](https://pages.github.com/](https://medium.com/@jan.schilpp/how-big-the-cheating-problem-in-counterstrike-2-actually-is-ad8fdc659d15)

This repository does not encompass the Python script to scrape and prepare the match data from csstats.gg because I do not want it to be abused. But you can find the data from matches between January 1 and January 7, 2024 as well as the scripts I used to analyze this data as presented in the Medium story. Feel free to replicate my analysis or try test your own hypotheses.
